# Future Improvements:

- [X] Added support for more VPN protocols.

# Detail

- This script can be used to automate the configuration of VPNs in a variety of scenarios.
- For example, the script can be used to configure VPNs to:

  - ***Connect remote offices to a corporate network.***
    
  - ***Connect remote users to a corporate network.***
    
  - ***Connect mobile devices to a corporate network.***


- To run the script, open a command prompt or PowerShell and run the following command:

      Create-VpnConnectionsFromXml <path_to_xml_file> [<destination_folder_for_configuration_files>]

- For example:
- 
      Create-VpnConnectionsFromXml C:\VPN\VPNConfigurations.xml C:\VPN\ClientConfigs

# Errors:

- The following errors may occur when running the script:

    ***Error 1:*** The XML file does not exist.
  
    ***Error 2:*** The XML file is not valid.
  
    ***Error 3:*** One or more parameters are invalid.
  
    ***Error 4:*** One or more errors occurred while creating the VPN connections.

- To resolve these errors, verify that the XML file exists and is valid. Also check that the provided parameters are valid. If the script is still generating errors, check the PowerShell log for more information.
